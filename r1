Subject: LCA filing today—OFLC resumed (Oct 31) and FLAG open; request to submit ETA-9035

Hi [Attorney Name],

I hope you’re well. I wanted to confirm next steps on my H-1B case now that the Department of Labor’s OFLC has resumed application processing as of Friday, October 31, 2025, and the FLAG portal is accessible again.

Could you please prepare and submit the LCA (ETA-9035/9035E) for my role today (Saturday, November 1, 2025) or as soon as feasible? I understand FLAG accepts submissions outside business hours, though adjudication will occur during DOL business days.

For the filing, please proceed with:

Position title, SOC code, and wage level consistent with prior drafts;

Work location(s) and any hybrid/remote language as needed;

Notice of filing for 10 calendar days (electronic posting where appropriate);

Start date within the 6-month filing window;

Any standard public access file updates once certified.

Given the restart and possible backlog, please let me know the expected certification timeline and whether we should plan for 7–10 business days or longer. If anything further is needed from me or my employer (e.g., FEIN verification, updated wage source, site addresses), I can provide it immediately.

For reference:

DOL/OFLC announcement (Oct 31, 2025) that application processing has resumed and FLAG is accessible.

LCA program page noting electronic filing requirements and 6-month window.

Typical LCA processing timeframe (7–10 business days).

Thank you for moving this forward.

Best regards,
