Description

Infrastructure Automation and Standardization:
This week, the EAP Big Data Engineering team enhanced the ozone_datanode.yml layout file to support fully automated filesystem provisioning for Cloudera Ozone DataNode hosts. The new changes were tested using the Citi Starfleet portal and executed successfully via the cti_rhel_eapbigdata_bdeng_vm_maintenance Ansible playbook with the datanode host type.

This improvement eliminates manual intervention from the Unix SA team during DataNode provisioning and ensures consistent and compliant volume group creation across all future deployments.

Key Achievements

Added and validated the vars/ozone_datanode.yml configuration in Git branch nov20 for datavg layout.

Enabled automated creation of logical volumes /data/1 through /data/10 for Ozone DataNodes.

Successfully tested execution of the Starfleet Ansible job on VM sd-dmvp-yluj targeting the datanode role.

Verified that filesystem provisioning completes without errors and supports Cloudera's deployment requirements.

Benefits to the Team

Eliminates dependency on Unix SA team for filesystem creation on DataNodes.

Reduces provisioning time during Ozone cluster expansion or hardware refresh cycles.

Ensures consistency and compliance across environments through version-controlled automation.

Improves operational efficiency by integrating the process into Starfleet’s self-service Ansible portal.

Next Steps

Promote this update to UAT and PROD branches after DEV validation.

Extend similar automation support for hybrid or mixed-disk layout DataNodes.

Monitor adoption across cluster builds and capture logs for continuous improvement.
