Next Step — Upload Spark Example JAR

Now that the resource exists, upload your JAR file to it.

./cde resource upload \
  --name spark-examples \
  --local-path spark-examples_2.11-2.4.8.7.1.9.1045-5.jar


Expected:

INFO Uploading file spark-examples_2.11-2.4.8.7.1.9.1045-5.jar
INFO Successfully uploaded resource spark-examples

🟢 Then Create and Run a Spark Job
./cde job create \
  --name spark-pi \
  --type spark \
  --mount-1-resource spark-examples \
  --jar spark-examples_2.11-2.4.8.7.1.9.1045-5.jar \
  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \
  --arg 10


Expected:

INFO Created job spark-pi


Then run it:

./cde job run --name spark-pi --wait


Expected:

INFO Job spark-pi started
INFO Job spark-pi completed successfully

✅ (Optional Validation)
